# Interactive Smoke
An example of interactive smoke in Unity inspired by Counter-Strike 2 utilizing Compute Shaders for interactions and Job System for propagation. The smoke fills the space within boundaries in the form of Perlin noise, which also affects its tint. This example uses [Massive Shooting](https://github.com/aleksandrpp/MassiveShooting) for projectile instancing, the smoke reacts to projectiles and impacts.
